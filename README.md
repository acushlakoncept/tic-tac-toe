This project is to demonstrate our knowledge of Object Oriented Programming Language in Ruby, building a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

# About the Game - Tic-Tac-Toe

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#:~:text=Tic%2Dtac%2Dtoe%20American,diagonal%20row%20is%20the%20winner.) Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner...[readmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe#:~:text=Tic%2Dtac%2Dtoe%20American,diagonal%20row%20is%20the%20winner.)

# User Interface
The game starts by calling the bin/main.rb file where all other classes are called/required. The game is played on the **CLI**

# Instructions

## Input
- At the beginning of the game, the two players are requested to enter their names, one after the other.
- The first person to enter his/her name automatically becomes player 1 and is requested to enter values 
between [1 - 9] to mark a piece on the board.
- Player 1 is automatically assigned to piece "X" and player 2 piece "O"


## Output
- The board class is instantiated at the beginning of the game with unmarked spots 1 to 9 on a 3x3 grid.
- The game board is re-rendered on the screen to show player's current placement of piece. Example if 
  player 1 takes position 5, is replaced with "X" and becomes unvailable till the end of the game.
- This repeats until win or draw conditions are met
- Players instructions are error messages are displayed at each intervals to guide the players


# Class Definitions

### **Game Class**:
The game class initializes the **_board class_** and the **_player class_**. It handles the _check winner_ and _draw methods_ as well as _switch player method_.

### **Player Class**:
Will interact with Board class to select where to place pieces
Pieces placed will be represented by X or O

### **Board Class**:
Will display the game board as well as locations of marked spots
Take input from players to determine where to show marked spots
